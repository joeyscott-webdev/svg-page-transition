SVG Page Transition

This is an example site with a really cool SVG page transition I thought I would share.  It utilizes
many frontend utilities including the following:
Bootstrap 4,
Fontawesome 5.8.1,
jQuery 3.3.1,
anime.js,
and animate.css.

I have also added a Bootstrap 4 jumbotron with a movie as the background which does a video load of the url in data-src.
